# GameHub

## Description

> Welcome to GameHub, a Java-based program developed as part of an online internship with SystemTron. GameHub serves as a sophisticated platform for accessing and enjoying a variety of classic games, all from a single, streamlined interface ([Main](https://github.com/karts13/GameHub/blob/main/Main.java)).
> Players can choose from an array of timeless games, including:
> * [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/karts13/GameHub/blob/main/RockPaperScissor.java)
> * [Connect 4](https://github.com/karts13/GameHub/blob/main/Connect4.java)
> * [Guess the Number](https://github.com/karts13/GameHub/blob/main/GuessTheNumber.java)
> * [TicTacToe](https://github.com/karts13/GameHub/blob/main/TicTacToe.java)

## How to Use this Code

> 1. Clone the Repository:
>    ```
>    https://github.com/karts13/GameHub.git
>    cd GameHub
>    ```
> 2. Compile the Java files to prepare for execution
>    ```
>    javac *.java
> 3. Execute the Main class to launch GameHub.
>    ```
>    java Main
>    ```
> 4. Upon running the program, a menu will be displayed with two options shown in [Output 2](https://github.com/karts13/GameHub/blob/main/README.md#sample-outputs).
> 5. Enter the number corresponding to your preferred game and press Enter.
> 6. Enter the GameHub atmosphere and enjoy playing the game of your choice.

## Customizations
> This code can be easily customized to meet your specific needs. Here are some things you may want to modify:
> * **Custome Game Rules:** Players could choose the range of numbers from which to guess in [Guess the Number](https://github.com/karts13/GameHub/blob/main/GuessTheNumber.java).
> * **Custom Grid Sizes:** The grid sizes in [Connect 4](https://github.com/karts13/GameHub/blob/main/Connect4.java) can be changed according to the difficulty level a player wants.
> * **Custom Symbols:** Instead of using the letters "X" and "O", players could use their own symbols (such as emojis or icons) in [TicTacToe](https://github.com/karts13/GameHub/blob/main/TicTacToe.java).
> 
> Please feel free to add any customizations that reflect your creativity.
